# Section 4: Population Analysis

**Q13**: Read this file into R and determine the sample size for each genotype and their corresponding median expression levels for each of these genotypes

```{r}
expr <- read.table("rs8067378_ENSG00000172057.6.txt")
head(expr)
```

```{r}
nrow(expr)
```

```{r}
table(expr$geno)
```

**Q14**: Generate a boxplot with a box per genotype, what could you infer from the relative expression value between A/A and G/G displayed in this plot? Does the SNP effect the expression of ORMDL3?

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
ggplot(expr) + aes(x = geno, y = exp, fill = geno) + geom_boxplot(notch = TRUE)
```

The relative difference between A\|A and G\|G is very large. We can determine this since the notches which represent the median do not overlap. I would think that the SNP does effect the expression of ORMDL3.
